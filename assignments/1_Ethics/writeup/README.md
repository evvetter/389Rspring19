## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

*First, your boss should be informed of the issue. If they can postpone the release, then nothing is wrong. Since auditing the firmware is your job, then it doesn't make sense to go to the public/watchdog before the company has had any chance to act on the audit. However, if the company is unwilling to act on the audit, then going from there to a consumer watchdog makes more sense than the public. Their role is to check this kind of oversight/recklessness through legal action, whereas revealing the security flaw to the public invites hackers to try and break the firmware themselves, possibly increasing risk. Regarding NDAs, it isn't ethical to stay mum about a serious security flaw if it could potentially result in harm. Given that you're a junior developer in the scenario, it stands to reason that hackers wouldn't have a hard time finding the vulnerability. If an NDA is part of the scenario, then it gets messier. While you wouldn't legally be held responsible should people get injured because of the ECU vulnerability, it wouldn't be ethical to allow people to come to harm through inaction. (right but impermissible versus wrong but permissible) In this scenario, I'd raise as much of a stink as possible to higher-ups to attempt to get them to change their mind on pushing the ECU out early, but if no progress is made then I'd go to a consumer watchdog as well as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to report the car as being dangerously vulnerable in its current state before the car is released for purchase.*
